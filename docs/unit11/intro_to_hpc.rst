Introduction to High Performance Computing
==========================================

To begin this unit, we will introduce the basis of high performance computing (HPC), and the 
general architecture of HPC systems at TACC. We will cover how to log in to an HPC system, and
navigate the different file systems available. After going through this module, you should be able
to:

* Describe the basic architecture of an HPC system
* Log in to an HPC system at TACC
* Navigate the different file systems available on TACC HPC systems



Basic HPC System Architecture
-----------------------------

As you prepare to use TACC systems for this unit, it is important to understand
the basic architecture. Think of an HPC resource as a very large and complicated lab
instrument. Users need to learn how to:

* Interface with it / push the right buttons (Linux)
* Load samples (data)
* Run experiments (jobs)
* Interpret the results (data analysis / vis)

   :target: ./images/hpc_schematic.png
   :alt: HPC System Architecture


Login vs. Compute Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A typical HPC system has login nodes and compute nodes. We cannot run
applications on the login nodes because they require too many resources and will 
interrupt the work of others. Instead, we must submit a job to a queue to run on compute nodes.


Tips for Success
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read the `documentation <https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/>`_.

* Learn node schematics, limitations, file systems, rules
* Learn about the scheduler, queues, policies
* Determine the right resource for the job


User Responsibility on Shared Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HPC systems are shared resources. Your jobs and activity on a cluster, if mismanaged,
can affect others. TACC staff are always `available to help <https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/about/help/>`_.

.. note::

   The welcome message you receive upon successful login to Lonestar6 has useful information
   for you to keep track of. Especially of note is the breakdown of disk quotas for your account,
   as you can keep an eye on whether your usage is nearing the determined limit. 
   
   Once your usage is nearing the quota, you'll start to experience issues that will not only
   impact your own work, but also impact the system for others. For example, if you're nearing
   your quota in ``$WORK``, and your job is repeatedly trying (and failing) to write to ``$WORK``,
   you will stress that file system.
   
   Another useful way to monitor your disk quotas (and TACC project balances) at any time is to execute:
   
   .. code-block:: console
   
      [ls6]$ /usr/local/etc/taccinfo


.. tip::

   Refer back to `Linux Essentials <../unit01/linux_essentials.html>`_ if you need a refresher on
   navigating Linux file systems.

Files in ``$SCRATCH`` are subject to purge if access time is more than 10 days old.


Navigating File Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To navigate the different file systems available on TACC HPC systems, you can use the standard
``cd`` command along with the ``PATH``, or you can use some TACC-specific shortcuts:

1. **Home Directory**: To change to your home directory, you can use:

   .. code-block:: console

      [ls6]$ cd $HOME
      # or
      [ls6]$ cd

2. **Work Directory**: To change to your work directory, you can use:

   .. code-block:: console

      [ls6]$ cd $WORK
      # or
      [ls6]$ cdw

2. **Scratch Directory**: To change to your scratch directory, you can use:

   .. code-block:: console

      [ls6]$ cd $SCRATCH
      # or
      [ls6]$ cds
